Creating a dev log for this project to track where it's at and my plans/ideas;

As of today (8/29/24), we have:

- working cube class w/ rotation transformation working (can render 3d)
- point, line, quadrilateral classes all working 
- matrix class w/ multiplication and other matrix ops working
- color working for all shapes

ideas for now/needed improvements:

- refactor Screen class; specifically how points are drawn to screen:
    - we don't want to have to manually clear/update points that we draw at each frame
    - instead, could we have a vector of shapes that are currently in the scene (this would require a Shape class that parent's all more specifically defined shapes)
    - at each frame, we loop thru vector of shapes and render their points
    - that way, when a shape is updated (transformed), we don't have to do any additional work on the Screen side of things

- add method for rotating cuboid around centroid (rather than just rotating in space) DONE
    - maybe it makes sense to add transformation methods to Point class?? think about this; put pen to paper and plan

- add additional constructor to rectangle/square class that takes center and length/width as params; then defines four paints based on these params
